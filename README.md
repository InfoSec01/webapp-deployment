# üöÄ DevOps Journey: From WebApp Deployment to CI/CD Automation

Welcome to my DevOps exploration! This project chronicles my hands-on experience with deploying a Python web application and setting up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions, Docker, and Ansible.

## üß© Project Overview

### 1. WebApp Deployment

**Objective**: Develop and prepare a Python web application for deployment.

**Key Components**:

- `app.py`: The main application script.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists Python dependencies.
- `venv/`: Python virtual environment for isolated package management.

**Progress**:

- Built a functional Python web application.
- Set up a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
- Prepared the application structure for deployment.

### 2. Git Lab Test

**Objective**: Implement CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions, Docker, and Ansible.

**Key Learnings**:

- **YAML Syntax**: Gained proficiency in writing and debugging YAML files for GitHub Actions.
- **Docker Integration**: Learned to containerize applications for consistent deployment environments.
- **Ansible Automation**: Automated deployment tasks using Ansible playbooks within CI/CD workflows.

## üìà Future Enhancements

- **Implement Deployment Scripts**: Add scripts to automate the deployment of the web application.
- **Enhance CI/CD Pipelines**: Introduce testing stages and deployment to staging/production environments.
- **Integrate Monitoring Tools**: Set up monitoring to track application performance post-deployment.
